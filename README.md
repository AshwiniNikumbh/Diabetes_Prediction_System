# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction System using Machine Learning

A Machine Learning based web application that predicts whether a person is diabetic or not based on various health parameters. The application is developed using **Python**, **Streamlit**, and **Scikit-Learn**.

## 📌 Project Overview

Diabetes is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide. Early detection can help in proper treatment and prevention of complications.

This project uses a trained Machine Learning model to predict diabetes based on medical attributes such as:

- Number of Pregnancies
- Glucose Level
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin Level
- BMI
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age

The application provides an easy-to-use web interface where users can enter their health details and instantly receive a prediction result.
